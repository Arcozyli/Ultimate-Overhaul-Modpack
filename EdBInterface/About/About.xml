	<description>This mod makes a handful of changes to the game's user interface.  Some features are only recommended for larger window sizes, but if you're running in a smaller window, you can shut off the features that do not work as well.
	
Adds the Colonist Status Bar along the top of the gameplay window, giving you another way to select colonists and to quickly see their status.
	 
Adds an Inventory dialog, showing counts of all of your colony's resources, apparel, weapons, buildings, etc.

Adds a Colonist button next to the Architect button.  Clicking the button selects a colonist.  Continue clicking to select each colonist in turn.  Left-clicking selects the next colonist.  Right-clicking selects the previous colonist.

Changes some of the game's panels and dialogs, including the Colonist panels, the Bills panel, the Growing panel and the Overview Work dialog.

If you don't like a particular feature in the mod, turn it off in the Interface Options dialog which you can get to from the gameplay main menu.

[Version 3.0.2 (Pre-Release)]
