 _____________________________________________________________________________

   have a building or resource to which it applies.
 - Re-ordered the building categories in the Inventory Dialog.

   menu.

 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 2.0.1 (2014-08-30) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

 - Added the Colonist Status Bar, which lists all of your colonists at the top
   of the map.
   - Click a colonist in the row to select that colonist.
   - Shift-click to add a colonist to the current selection.
   - Double-click a colonist to center the map on that colonist.
   - Green status means that a colonist is healthy; yellow is wounded; red
     is incapacitated.
   - Dead colonists are automatically removed when they are buried or can be
     removed manually by right-clicking on them and selecting the appropriate
     option.
   - Missing colonists (kidnapped or otherwise missing from the map) can be
     removed by right-clicking and selecting the appropriate option.
 - Added an Inventory screen, triggered by an Inventory button in the dialog
   buttons section.  This screen shows categorized counts for all resources,
   weapons, apparel and buildings. (Much of credit for this idea goes to 
   Joretap0 and his Inventory Panel--the implementation is different, but the
   idea is the same).
 - Added an "Interface Settings" dialog accessible from the main menu during
   gameplay.  Most of the features added by the mod can be turned on and off
   here.
 - Added passion indicators to the Work tab in the Overview menu.  An extra
   border to the left and right of the checkboxes indicate the two passion
   levels.  The colored numbers in the manual priorities dialog now indicate
   passion level--gray for no passion, yellow for interested, green for
   burning passion (credit to LuciferNZ for the idea).
 - Added a replacement for the Growing tab pabel that uses radio buttons in
   a scrollable list instead of a drop-down menu.
 - Added an option (not enabled by default) to create all resource stockpiles
   with all resources disabled so that you don't need to deselect all of the
   defaults.
 - The mod now auto-detects screen resolution changes during gameplay and
   disables the alternate tabs if they do not fit.
 - BUGFIX: You can now cancel mining designations when selecting a map square
   designated for mining.
 - BUGFIX: Fixed some word wrapping issues in the Health tab

 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 1.2.2 (2014-08-17) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

 - Added support for windows smaller than 900 pixels high.  Uses the tab
   panels from the vanilla game in these cases, with the next and previous
   colonist arrow buttons added to them.  The mod decides which tab panels
   to use when it switches into gameplay mode from the main menu.  If you
   change your resolution in the middle of a game, the tab panels will not
   change.  Save your game, go to the main menu and reload it to get the
   panels to switch.

 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 1.2.1 (2014-08-17) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

 - Supports Alpha 6
 - Split the "Status" tab back out into "Health" and "Thoughts" tabs to match
   the vanilla game, but moved the Food and Sleep meters from the Health tab
   into the Thoughts tab.
 - Renamed translation keys to avoid naming conflicts with vanilla or other
   mods.
 - BUGFIX: The initializer is now defined as a building instead of as a pawn,
   which fixes a couple of issues.  The initializer definition no longer
   appears in stockpiles under the animal corpses and meat sections.  Games
   saved while the mod was enabled should now load when the mod is disabled
   without the "Could not load reference to EdBInterface_Meat/Corpse" errors.
   Saved games from previous versions will need to be saved again to remove
   these errors.

 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 1.1.1 (2014-08-11) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

 - BUGFIX: Next and previous buttons in the "Status" tab should no longer
   appear as green or red buttons.
 - BUGFIX: Selected zones no longer display invalid designation commands.
 - Reworked the Bills tab.  The most notable change is the addition of the
   repeat options to the tab interface.  You no longer need to open the config
   dialog to get to these options.
 - The Colonist button does a better job of trying to restore the tab that
   was open the last time that you used it.
 - Changed the mod initialization so that it no longer relies on definitions
   in the Races_Humanoid.xml file.
 - Changed the mod controller so that it no longer gets called every frame.
 - Better compatibility with other mods
 - Resized the Bills, Growing and Storage tabs to match the width of the 
   colonist tabs (for consistency).
 - Made the Designation info box a little taller to better fit building names
   from translations and mods. 

   _____________________________________________________________________________
 
   Version 1.0.1 (2014-08-08) 
 _____________________________________________________________________________

 - Added a Colonist button next to the Architect button.  Clicking the button
   selects a colonist.  Continue clicking to select each colonist in turn.

   previous colonist.

   on that colonist.

   and previous Colonist.

   is selected, a "Hunt" button appears.
