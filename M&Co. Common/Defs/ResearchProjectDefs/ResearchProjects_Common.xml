    <description>   Experiment with the fixed batteries to develop a mobile power supply.

- Develop an energy pack. It is used to power mobile devices.
    </description>
    <descriptionDiscovered>   You have developed a new battery type that can be moved as an energy pack once fully loaded.

- You can now make energy packs.
- Energy pack must be linked to your power net to charge up. They will be usable once fully loaded.

		<description>   After electrocuting himself while trying to repair a short-circuited battery under rain, one of your colonist had the idea to develop an electronic protection module.

- Develop some electronic components to produce integrated electronics boards and eletronic chips.
    </description>
    <descriptionDiscovered>   Your researchers have developed several basic electronic components. Combined together by a crafty man, they will form integrated circuits boards.

- You can now build an electronic workbench.
- You can now make integrated circuits boards and electronic chips at the electronic workbench.
