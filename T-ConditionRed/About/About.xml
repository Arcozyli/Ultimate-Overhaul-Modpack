  <description>Build alert lamps to provide suitable mood lighting for your colony when the going gets tough. They glow greenish-white when everything is safe but change to either yellow or flashing red depending on how many enemies are in the local area. Alert lamps require a threat sensor somewhere in your colony to work correctly and are available after researching colored lights.</description>
